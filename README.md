# Classifying emotions in English text
**(Capstone Project for UC Berkeley ML/AI Professional Certificate)**

In this project, I attempt to classify the predominant emotion expressed in English social media texts into 6 categories: anger (0), fear (1), joy (2), love (3), sadness (4) and surprise (5).

I have always been curious about understanding more about human behaviour, and using data as the means to do so. The initial idea behing this project wa sparked by watching *Inside Out 2* earlier this summer, and my motivation here is to strengthen my foundation in classification techniques, and build my skill-set in text analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Introduction

## Models

### TF-IDF and Classification

### Word2Vec and Classification using Logistic Regression

### BERT Transformer and Keras for Classification

## What is accuracy?
Classify a completely new dataset of 10 personal social media posts and see if they are classified correctly by the models.

## Hierarchical Classification


## Next Steps
